Net/BGP4 version 0.01
=====================

This module is an implementation of the BGP4 inter-domain
routing protocol. It encapsulates all of the functionality
needed to establish and maintain a BGP4 peering session and
exchange routing update information with the peer. It aims
to provide a simple API to the BGP4 protocol for the purposes
of automation, logging, monitoring, testing, and similar
tasks using the power and flexibility of perl. The module
does not implement the functionality of a RIB (Routing
Information Base) nor does it modify the kernel routing table
of the host system. However, such operations could be
implemented using the API provided by the module.
